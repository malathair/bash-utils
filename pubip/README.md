## About

This is a simple bash script to pretty print your current public IP address. There's nothing special about this one,
it's just a small quality of life tweak as well as being a shorthand for `curl ifconfig.me`.

## Installation

Run the following to install to your user's private bin:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malathair/cli-tools/main/pubip/install.sh | bash
```

or alternatively you can run this to install globally for all users:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malathair/cli-tools/main/pubip/install.sh | sudo bash
```
