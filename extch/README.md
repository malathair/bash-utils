## About

This is a simple bash script to make bulk file extension changes.
It will change all files of the specified extension to the new extension.

This was just a quick and dirty hack to facilitate extension changes during a project I was working on a while back.
I haven't really used it since and it's honestly probably a useless utility with there being other tools and/or better
methods of achieving the same thing.

## Installation

Run the following to install to your user's private bin:
